<p>
Cellular telephones installed in or carried aboard airplanes, balloons
or any other type of aircraft must not be operated while such aircraft
are airborne (not touching the ground). When any aircraft leaves the
ground, all cellular telephones on board that aircraft must be turned
off. The following notice must be posted on or near each cellular
telephone installed in any aircraft:

<p>
“The use of cellular telephones while this aircraft is airborne is
prohibited by FCC rules, and the violation of this rule could result
in suspension of service and/or a fine. The use of cellular telephones
while this aircraft is on the ground is subject to FAA regulations.”

<p>
This subpart applies to the operation of unmanned free
balloons. However, a person operating an unmanned free balloon within
a restricted area must comply only with §101.33 (d) and (e) and with
any additional limitations that are imposed by the using or
controlling agency, as appropriate.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
No person may operate an unmanned free balloon—
</p>

<p>
(a) Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, below 2,000 feet above the
surface within the lateral boundaries of the surface areas of Class B,
Class C, Class D, or Class E airspace designated for an airport;
</p>

<p>
(b) At any altitude where there are clouds or obscuring phenomena of
more than five-tenths coverage;
</p>

<p>
(c) At any altitude below 60,000 feet standard pressure altitude where
the horizontal visibility is less than five miles;
</p>

<p>
(d) During the first 1,000 feet of ascent, over a congested area of a
city, town, or settlement or an open-air assembly of persons not
associated with the operation; or
</p>

<p>
(e) In such a manner that impact of the balloon, or part thereof
including its payload, with the surface creates a hazard to persons or
property not associated with the operation.

<h3 id="sec-2-3">101.35 Equipment and marking requirements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
(a) No person may operate an unmanned free balloon unless—
</p>

<p>
(1) It is equipped with at least two payload cut-down systems or
    devices that operate independently of each other;
</p>

<p>
(2) At least two methods, systems, devices, or combinations
    thereof, that function independently of each other, are
    employed for terminating the flight of the balloon envelope;
    and
</p>

<p>
(3) The balloon envelope is equipped with a radar reflective
    device(s) or material that will present an echo to surface
    radar operating in the 200 MHz to 2700 MHz frequency range.
</p>

<p>
The operator shall activate the appropriate devices required by
paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section when weather conditions
are less than those prescribed for operation under this subpart,
or if a malfunction or any other reason makes the further
operation hazardous to other air traffic or to persons and
property on the surface.
</p>

<p>
(b) No person may operate an unmanned free balloon below 60,000 feet
    standard pressure altitude between sunset and sunrise (as
    corrected to the altitude of operation) unless the balloon and its
    attachments and payload, whether or not they become separated
    during the operation, are equipped with lights that are visible
    for at least 5 miles and have a flash frequency of at least 40,
    and not more than 100, cycles per minute.
</p>

<p>
(c) No person may operate an unmanned free balloon that is equipped
    with a trailing antenna that requires an impact force of more than
    50 pounds to break it at any point, unless the antenna has colored
    pennants or streamers that are attached at not more than 50 foot
    intervals and that are visible for at least one mile.
</p>

<p>
(d) No person may operate between sunrise and sunset an unmanned free
    balloon that is equipped with a suspension device (other than a
    highly conspicuously colored open parachute) more than 50 feet
    along, unless the suspension device is colored in alternate bands
    of high conspicuity colors or has colored pennants or streamers
    attached which are visible for at least one mile.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
(a) Prelaunch notice: Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this
    section, no person may operate an unmanned free balloon unless,
    within 6 to 24 hours before beginning the operation, he gives the

    the place of intended operation:
</p>

<p>

<p>
(2) The estimated date and time of launching, amended as necessary
    to remain within plus or minus 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
(3) The location of the launching site.
</p>

<p>
(4) The cruising altitude.
</p>

<p>

    suspension device, weight of the payload, and length of the
    trailing antenna.
</p>

(8) The forecast time and location of impact with the surface of
    the earth.

    period of flight, the person operating an unmanned free balloon
    shall immediately notify the nearest FAA ATC facility. The notice
    shall include the last recorded position and any revision of the
    forecast trajectory. The nearest FAA ATC facility shall be
    notified immediately when tracking of the balloon is
    re-established.
