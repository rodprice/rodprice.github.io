They say you should be ready to toss out your first attempt at a
design, but I kind of like this one.  I'm planning to use it to test
the 432 MHz beacon -- the one that doesn't do much other than go
"beep, beep, beep."  It's a bit beefy at about 100 grams, so I'm
pretty sure we're going to need another go-around.

I'd like to get the young men in the ward thinking about the design of
a new version of this antenna that we will actually fly.  I could use
some ideas. 

It's most important characteristic, aside from not weighing 100 grams,
will be it's ability to land right-side up.  It doesn't have to point
straight up, just maybe better than 45 degrees from vertical.  And it
has to be strong enough not to be bent up too much when it lands.
(That's why I used 8 gauge copper wire, but that's heavy stuff.)

This is important because the 432 MHz beacon is our backup
transmitter.  I don't anticipate that the 144 MHz APRS transmitter
will work too well once the balloon is on the ground, for the simple
reason that its antenna is a dipole, and will almost certainly lie
flat on the ground when it lands.  

A dipole is constructed from two quarter-wave wires.  At 144 MHz,
that's about 1/2 meter per wire.  It's hard to imagine that we could
find some way to make that antenna stand up.  On the other hand, at
432 MHz, the wavelength is about 70 cm, which means that a
quarter-wave wire is about 17.5 cm long.  That's much more
manageable.  

So how can we lighten this thing up, while making it strong and
stable?  It's OK to use some other part of the payload as a
counterweight, but ideally I'd like to make the antenna itself weigh
only about 1/3 what the current one weighs.
