* MSP430

 - Texas Instrument's [[http://www.ti.com/msp430][MSP430 site]]
 
** Tutorials

 - [[http://www.simplyembedded.org][Simply Embedded]]'s excellent series of programming [[http://www.simplyembedded.org/tutorials/][tutorials]] for the
   MSP430.  This takes you through setting up a toolchain with the gcc
   compiler and mspdebug, sets up a makefile with a nice project
   structure, covers the MSP430 clocks, timers, and interrupts, and
   more.  Great stuff, if somewhat hardcore.
