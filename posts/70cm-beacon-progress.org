We're putting two radios on the high-altitude balloon, just to have a
backup in case one of them fails.  We're pretty confident that the 
balloon will fly, but we'd like to get it back, and radio beacons are
the best way to do that.

Soldering tiny little parts can be painful -- especially when you
really would prefer not to fry your part with too much heat.  Such was
the case when I tried to attach wires to the 70 cm transmitter modules
I had bought for the balloon.  You can see one of them in the picture
with the quarter, to the left.

And I had bought two of them, just in case!  Normally, you solder to
these things using a header, which has pins every 0.1 inches.  Not
this thing.  It had to have them every 2 mm.  Just different enough to
make things difficult.

So I fried two of them, so badly that I actually cracked several of
the parts on the boards in pieces.  For those of you who've never
soldered electronic parts before, that's really bad.  

When I was in college, I had a summer job soldering electronic parts 8
hours a day.  I got pretty good at it, I thought.  Maybe not so much.

After I tossed out the two blackened transmitters, I found that I was
just stubborn enough to try again.  I ordered a new transmitter, this
time with 10 times the output power (an entire watt).  I got a new,
smaller tip for the soldering iron, made a plan this time instead of
just having at it, and ... success!

You can see the result in the picture below, with the penny next to
the transmitter.
