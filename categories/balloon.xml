&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hubris: "Morse code was invented 150 years ago.  It's trivial."  And,
"that guy did a pathetically bad job with his code.  I could knock out
something way better in an hour or two."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps my particular variation on hubris began with my insistence on
cramming a Morse code generator, pseudo-noise generator, and a couple
of other bits into a processor with 128 bytes of RAM and 2 kB flash,
an &lt;a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/MSP430G2231IPW14R/"&gt;MSP430G2231&lt;/a&gt;.  This little guy sells for 62 cents each in quantity.
I had a few on hand, and since this was going to be a throwaway
project – we wanted to test it by strapping it to a party balloon and
letting it fly away until we couldn't hear it anymore – I thought I'd
give it a try.  Perhaps another day I'll write about all the things I
like about the MSP430.  This post is about 128 bytes of RAM, 2 kB
flash memory, and a 1 MHz clock rate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Truth be told, the trouble really got started when I decided that I
would implement an &lt;a href="http://in.ncu.edu.tw/~ncume_ee/digilogi/prbs.htm"&gt;m-sequence&lt;/a&gt; generator as well as a Morse code
generator.  You can get a lot of coding gain out of m-sequences, for
which there's a surprisingly fast and simple algorithm.  The problem
isn't implementing it – it literally took four lines of C code –
but I wanted to run it at audio rates.  That meant I needed to run it
in an interrupt-driven way.  In turn, that persuaded me that I should
build an interrupt-driven Morse code generator.
&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon delivered the really cheap transmitter/receiver pair that I
talked about in my last blog entry, and I wired them up on the
breadboard.  I programmed an Arduino to turn the transmitter on for a
moment, pause for a while, then repeat.  Here's what the spectrum
analyzer had to say:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.shinypenny.org/images/xy-mk-5v.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Cheap 433 MHz receiver-transmitter pair" src="http://www.shinypenny.org/images/xy-mk-5v.jpg" title="Cheap 433 MHz receiver-transmitter pair" style="float:right;width:35%;margin:10px"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We've been having trouble getting the 433 MHz beacon (otherwise known
as the 70 cm beacon) going, so one of our partners Richard suggested
we use a very simple beacon that just needs power and a bit stream.
I've shown a picture of the two at right.  I thought I'd give it a
try, so I bought a few.  Sparkfun was backordered so I searched on
Amazon and found people selling six transmitter-receiver pairs for
$10.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The transmitters are 25 mW at 12V power supply.  We could use a 9V
battery and get 15-20 mW out of it.  I checked the frequency against
the Colorado ham radio &lt;a href="http://shinypenny.org/papers/colorado-70cm-band-plan.pdf"&gt;band plan for 70 cm&lt;/a&gt; (tells you what modulations
are allowed where) and found that 433.92 MHz was right in the middle
of a band where the FCC does not allow repeaters – good for us.
Nothing would infuriate a bunch of hams, and generate complaints to
the FCC, faster than running a beacon on a repeater frequency.  The
transmitter modules are so cheap that their center frequency can drift
over +/- 0.5 MHz, and probably will when the temperature varies.
Fortunately the band is about 1.5 MHz wide.
&lt;/p&gt;

Antennas always surprise me.  My intuition just doesn't work very
well.  For instance, you would think that the big radials I put on the
70 cm beacon antenna would block the RF radiated below it to at least
some degree.  Modeling it with the &lt;a href="http://www.qsl.net/4nec2/"&gt;4NEC2&lt;/a&gt; code shows that it doesn't!
Not at all.  It's supposed to act like a ground plane, and RF doesn't
go through ground planes…
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.shinypenny.org/images/balloon/434-mhz-wireless-transceiver-rfm69hcw.jpg"&gt;
&lt;img alt="My first try at soldering a transmitter" src="http://www.shinypenny.org/images/balloon/434-mhz-wireless-transceiver-rfm69hcw.jpg" title="My first try at soldering a transmitter" style="float:left;width:35%;margin:10px"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We're putting two radios on the high-altitude balloon, just to have a
backup in case one of them fails.  We're pretty confident that the 
balloon will fly, but we'd like to get it back, and radio beacons are
the best way to do that.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Soldering tiny little parts can be painful – especially when you
really would prefer not to fry your part with too much heat.  Such was
the case when I tried to attach wires to the 70 cm transmitter modules
I had bought for the balloon.  You can see one of them in the picture
with the quarter, to the left.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And I had bought two of them, just in case!  Normally, you solder to
these things using a header, which has pins every 0.1 inches.  Not
this thing.  It had to have them every 2 mm.  Just different enough to
make things difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So I fried two of them, so badly that I actually cracked several of
the parts on the boards in pieces.  For those of you who've never
soldered electronic parts before, that's really bad.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I was in college, I had a summer job soldering electronic parts 8
hours a day.  I got pretty good at it, I thought.  Maybe not so much.
&lt;/p&gt;

If we launched a high-altitude balloon from my house tomorrow morning,
here's what might happen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.shinypenny.org/images/balloon/432-MHz-antenna.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="First attempt at a 432 MHz antenna" src="http://www.shinypenny.org/images/balloon/432-MHz-antenna.png" title="First attempt at a 432 MHz antenna" style="float:right;width:35%;margin:10px"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They say you should be ready to toss out your first attempt at a
design, but I kind of like this one.  I'm planning to use it to test
the 432 MHz beacon – the one that doesn't do much other than go
"beep, beep, beep."  It's a bit beefy at about 100 grams, so I'm
pretty sure we're going to need another go-around.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's most important characteristic, aside from not weighing 100 grams,
will be it's ability to land right-side up.  It doesn't have to point
straight up, just maybe better than 45 degrees from vertical.  And it
has to be strong enough not to be bent up too much when it lands.
(That's why I used 8 gauge copper wire, but that's heavy stuff.)
&lt;/p&gt;

We anticipate that our balloon will take maybe an hour after launch to
get to 100,000 feet altitude.  From there you can see the curvature of
the Earth.  The sky is black, and the highest clouds are far below.
We'll be taking pictures and video and measuring stuff.  We haven't
decided what yet.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is near-space.  Richard tells me that conditions up here are like
the surface of Mars.  Air pressure is about 0.01 atmosphere.
Temperatures can be as low as -50 C.  There's no ozone layer to keep
out the ultraviolet light.  We have to make sure the payload works
under these conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

Some friends and I are building and launching a high-altitude balloon,
and we want a camera on board.  Of course we want a camera!  We have
to see what it looks like up there.
