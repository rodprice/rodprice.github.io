Experimenting with driving the transmitter with various voltages gives
the following results:

| voltage | current | power  |
|---------+---------+--------|
| 12 V    | 32 mA   | -27 dB |
| 9 V     | 25 mA   | -29 dB |
| 6 V     | 19 mA   | -30 dB |
| 5 V     | 17 mA   | -32 dB |
| 3 V     | 12 mA   | -36 dB |

These power readings are very highly variable, but they definitely
show a trend.  And the transmitter is a real power hog.  I'll probably
go with a 9 volt battery.

Just so.
