It turns out that people have learned to hack little Canon point and
shoot cameras.  You can do all kinds of things like, say, make your
camera take a picture every 5 seconds and take a 30 second video every
five minutes.  The project is called the "Canon Hacker Development
Kit" or [[http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK][CHDK]].  The following video shows how it works.  [[http://lifehacker.com/5942229/unlock-the-secret-pro-features-of-your-canon-point-and-shoot-camera-with-chdk][Here]] is the
[[http://lifehacker.com/][LifeHacker]] article the video came from.
