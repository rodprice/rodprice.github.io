&lt;p&gt;
Hubris: "Morse code was invented 150 years ago.  It's trivial."  And,
"that guy did a pathetically bad job with his code.  I could knock out
something way better in an hour or two."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps my particular variation on hubris began with my insistence on
cramming a Morse code generator, pseudo-noise generator, and a couple
of other bits into a processor with 128 bytes of RAM and 2 kB flash,
an &lt;a href="http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/MSP430G2231IPW14R/"&gt;MSP430G2231&lt;/a&gt;.  This little guy sells for 62 cents each in quantity.
I had a few on hand, and since this was going to be a throwaway
project – we wanted to test it by strapping it to a party balloon and
letting it fly away until we couldn't hear it anymore – I thought I'd
give it a try.  Perhaps another day I'll write about all the things I
like about the MSP430.  This post is about 128 bytes of RAM, 2 kB
flash memory, and a 1 MHz clock rate.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Truth be told, the trouble really got started when I decided that I
would implement an &lt;a href="http://in.ncu.edu.tw/~ncume_ee/digilogi/prbs.htm"&gt;m-sequence&lt;/a&gt; generator as well as a Morse code
generator.  You can get a lot of coding gain out of m-sequences, for
which there's a surprisingly fast and simple algorithm.  The problem
isn't implementing it – it literally took four lines of C code –
but I wanted to run it at audio rates.  That meant I needed to run it
in an interrupt-driven way.  In turn, that persuaded me that I should
build an interrupt-driven Morse code generator.
&lt;/p&gt;
