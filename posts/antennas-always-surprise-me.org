Antennas always surprise me.  My intuition just doesn't work very
well.  For instance, you would think that the big radials I put on the
70 cm beacon antenna would block the RF radiated below it to at least
some degree.  Modeling it with the [[http://www.qsl.net/4nec2/][4NEC2]] code shows that it doesn't!
Not at all.  It's supposed to act like a ground plane, and RF doesn't
go through ground planes...

The radiation pattern I got from 4NEC2 (in the vertical plane) is
shown at right.  The symmetry from top to bottom is precise.  Weird.
Another thing I learned from 4NEC2: it turns out that the angle of the
radials with respect to the antenna vertical really does matter.  I
thought you could do just about anything you wanted with them, but
while it doesn't affect the radiation pattern of the antenna, it does
affect its impedance at the feed point.

So here's the new antenna, shown below.  The radials go down at about
60 degrees, to give 50 ohms at the feed point.  I spent about a day
getting the modeling software to work, and about two minutes bending
the antenna radials to spec.
