We anticipate that our balloon will take maybe an hour after launch to
get to 100,000 feet altitude.  From there you can see the curvature of
the Earth.  The sky is black, and the highest clouds are far below.
We'll be taking pictures and video and measuring stuff.  We haven't
decided what yet.

This is near-space.  Richard tells me that conditions up here are like
the surface of Mars.  Air pressure is about 0.01 atmosphere.
Temperatures can be as low as -50 C.  There's no ozone layer to keep
out the ultraviolet light.  Things can be a bit rough.

Then we have to get the payload back to Earth.  The balloon is made of
material designed to burst at altitude.  At that point, a parachute
takes over, but since the air is so thin, there's not much it can do
to slow things down.  I've read that payloads can accelerate to almost
the speed of sound.

Sooner or later the air gets thick enough that the parachute can do
some good.  Since we don't want to chase the balloon clear across
Kansas, however, we've chosen a parachute that will slow the balloon
only to about 50 mph.  It's going to hit the ground hard.

The point of all this is to say that we have some work to do to ensure
that the payload we build can survive all this.  Hence the title of
this post.  We're going to test, test, and then test some more.
Here's how we're going to do it: 

We're going to kick the payload down the stairs.  Literally.  

If the payload can't survive a trip down the stairs at my house
(pictured) it's not going to make it on the balloon.  Then we're going
to put the payload in dry ice for a while to see if it works when it's
cold.  It's got to be strong, tough, insulated against the cold, and
lightweight.  So we're going to test, test, test.
