Hubris: "Morse code was invented 150 years ago.  It's trivial."  And,
"that guy did a pathetically bad job with his code.  I could knock out
something way better in an hour or two."

Perhaps my particular variation on hubris began with my insistence on
cramming a Morse code generator, pseudo-noise generator, and a couple
of other bits into a processor with 128 bytes of RAM and 2 kB flash,
an [[http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/MSP430G2231IPW14R/][MSP430G2231]].  This little guy sells for 62 cents each in quantity.
I had a few on hand, and since this was going to be a throwaway
project -- we wanted to test it by strapping it to a party balloon and
letting it fly away until we couldn't hear it anymore -- I thought I'd
give it a try.  Perhaps another day I'll write about all the things I
like about the MSP430.  This post is about 128 bytes of RAM, 2 kB
flash memory, and a 1 MHz clock rate.

Truth be told, the trouble really got started when I decided that I
would implement an [[http://in.ncu.edu.tw/~ncume_ee/digilogi/prbs.htm][m-sequence]] generator as well as a Morse code
generator.  You can get a lot of coding gain out of m-sequences, for
which there's a surprisingly fast and simple algorithm.  The problem
isn't implementing it -- it literally took four lines of C code --
but I wanted to run it at audio rates.  That meant I needed to run it
in an interrupt-driven way.  In turn, that persuaded me that I should
build an interrupt-driven Morse code generator.

#+begin_html

#+end_html

There's nothing wrong with interrupt-driven code.  In fact, for the
MSP430 it's the Right Way to Do It.  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#Timing][Wikipedia article]] on Morse
code gives specs for timing: one time unit (tick) for a dot, three for
a dash, with one tick between symbols (dots and dashes), three between
letters, and seven between words.  Nice and regular, and therefore a
good fit for interrupt-driven code.

That lead me to think about a state machine.  At each trip through the
interrupt code, that is, at each time tick, the state machine
advances, sending out a dot, a space, a third of a dash, etc.  It
ticks through the message to be sent until it's all done, and then it
quits.  

I came up with what I still think is a clever way to represent the
state, involving two 8-bit registers, ~mcode~ and ~mchar~.  ~mcode~
holds the dots and dashes comprising a letter, where 1 represents a
dash and 0 represents a dot.  For example, the Morse code for the
letter C in this scheme is 1010, dash-dot-dash-dot.  No Morse code
letter has more than seven dots and dashes, so it all fits in a byte.

The structure of the dots and dashes is found in the second register,
~mchar~.  A dot followed by a space is 10, and a dash followed by a
space is 1110.  The space between letters followed by a dot and space
is 0010, and the space between letters followed by a dash and a space
is 001110.  The space between words, seven ticks, is 0000.  Again,
this fits into a single byte.

The state machine proceeds by sending the left-most bit (MSB) in
~mchar~ to the transmitter and shifting ~mchar~ to the left on each
tick.  When the symbol (dot or dash) is completely done, the MSB of
~mcode~ is read to determine whether the next symbol is a dot or a
dash, the new symbol is put into ~mchar~, and ~mcode~ is shifted to the
left.

The rub, and I think the clever part, comes when the state machine has
finished a complete symbol ~mchar~ or letter ~mcode~.  How does the
state machine know when to stop?  The answer lies in the value of the
bit that goes in the right-most bit (LSB) when the left-shift takes
place.

For ~mchar~, it's simple.  I always put in a 1.  The bits comprising
~mchar~ always end in 0.  When the last 0 (space) is shifted out, the
register contains all 1's.  When that happens, it's time to look at
the next symbol in ~mcode~.

This gives us five symbols to deal with, shown in the C code below.

#+name: code: test
#+begin_src  C

#define DOT       0b10111111
#define DASH      0b11101111
#define SPACEDOT  0b00101111
#define SPACEDASH 0b00111011
#define SPACEWORD 0b00001111

#+end_src

You can see that the relevant bits of the symbol are pushed as far to
the left as possible, with 1's padding the symbol on the right.  The
spaces between symbols, letters, and words fall out correctly, as you
can see in this example:

#+name: Linux debug code output
#+begin_example

    A -> __o_ooo___
    D -> ooo_o_o___
    0 -> ooo_ooo_ooo_ooo_ooo___
    Y -> ooo_o_ooo_ooo___
    X -> ooo_o_o_ooo___
      -> ____
    s -> o_o_o___
    e -> o___
    n -> ooo_o___
    d -> ooo_o_o___
    i -> o_o___
    n -> ooo_o___
    g -> ooo_ooo_o___
      -> ____
    m -> ooo_ooo___
    - -> ooo_o_o_o_o_ooo_

#+end_example

Here I'm showing the beginning of the message "AD0YX sending
m-sequence".  An underscore =_= denotes a space and =o= denotes a
"mark"; that is, a space means no signal and a mark means a signal.
You can see that this is generating correct Morse code, and with the
proper timing.

So now we know how to generate dots and dashes, and put in appropriate
spaces.  I haven't yet explained how to assemble those dots and dashes
into meaningful Morse code.  To do that, we use the ~mcode~ register.
When the ~mchar~ register is all 1's, that signals the state machine
to pop off the next dot or dash from the ~mcode~ register and load the
next symbol into ~mchar~.  A left-shift of ~mcode~ queues up the next
dot or dash.

I use a lookup table to go from ASCII to the ~mcode~ templates.
Here's a small section:

#+name: ASCII to Morse lookup table
#+begin_src C

static const uint8_t morse[MORSE_LUT_SIZE] =
  {
    0b11111000,                 /* '0' */
    0b01111000,                 /* '1' */
    0b00111000,                 /* '2' */
    0b00011000,                 /* '3' */
    0b00001000,                 /* '4' */
    0b00000111,                 /* '5' */
    0b10000111,                 /* '6' */
    0b11000111,                 /* '7' */
    0b11100111,                 /* '8' */
    0b11110111,                 /* '9' */
    0b01000000,                 /* 'A' */
    0b10001111,                 /* 'B' */
    0b10101111,                 /* 'C' */
    ...

#+end_src

In the notation I used above, an 'A' is =o_ooo_=.  Here it's just
written =01=, for a dot followed by a dash.  =0= for a dot; =1= for a
dash.  That leaves six more bits in ~mcode~.  This time there's no
guarantee that the last information-carrying bit will be a =0=, as it
was in ~mchar~.  Now the state machine is looking for either all 0's
or all 1's to signal that the current letter is completely sent.  If
the letter ends in a dash, so that the last meaningful bit is =1=, I
fill the rest with 0's.  If, on the other hand, the letter ends in a
dot, I fill the rest with 1's.

Once the state machine sees that it's time for a new letter (a new
~mcode~ template) we have to put in three spaces to indicate that a
full letter has been sent.  That's what the symbols  ~SPACEDOT~ and
~SPACEDASH~ are for.  The next dot or dash to go out uses one of those
two rather than ~DOT~ or ~DASH~, and there are the three required
spaces between letters.

How about spaces between words?  For this I use a bit of a trick.  If
the lookup table can't find a Morse code template for a letter, it
returns an error code.  This error code doesn't correspond to any
Morse code template.  The state machine sees that, and inserts a
~SPACEWORD~ into ~mcode~.  The next time through the lookup table,
either the state machine gets a valid ~mcode~, or it hits the end of
the message string and stops.

All this sounds straightforward, but getting it right was really
painful.  I spent almost a week of nights after work struggling with
it.  I think I threw away four or five attempts before I got it right.
This was far from "knock it out in an hour or two."  And that was just
to get it running under Linux.  Getting it onto the MSP430 chip was
another matter entirely.

Here is the logic that finally worked:

#+name: State machine logic
#+begin_src C

/* Sends a new bit at every call until ring buffer is empty */
BIT tock() {
  if (donechar()) {
    if (donecode()) {
      if (rbempty(&ring)) { 
        mcode = ZEROS;
        mchar = ZEROS;
        return 0;         /* wait for new letters */
      } else {
        mcode = rbget(&ring);
        if (mcode == ONES)
          mchar = SPACEWORD;
        else
          nextspacecode();
      }
    } else {
      nextcode();
    }
  }
  iowrite(nextchar());
  return 1;
}

#+end_src

Notice the bit about the ring buffer?  (shiver..)  It's a little queue
that takes Morse code from the main loop and makes it available to the
interrupt routine above.  That way you can asynchronously push Morse
code into the queue whenever it becomes available from the main loop,
and have it sent out from the interrupt routine timed correctly.

I won't put you through the pain I had trying to get that to work.  It
worked fine on Linux, where everything runs sequentially and there's
no running out of time before the next interrupt comes along.  Running
concurrently in real time on the MSP430 just didn't work, and I still
don't know why.  In the end, rather than throw the thing down on the
floor and stomp on it, I just stuffed every last bit of code into the
interrupt routine and called it good.

If I ever get it to work, I'll write a post about it.  (Bet you can't
wait for that.)  This got me so cranked up that I pulled out my formal
methods [[http://alloy.mit.edu][book]] and started building a model before I came to myself.
It's only a little throw-away transmitter, after all.  Sheesh.

After all that, I've got running code on the MSP430 that pushes out
Morse code as fast as you would like.  On an ARM chip you could
probably do 100,000 wpm with it, it's that lean and efficient.  Way
over-engineered.  It's only a little throw-away transmitter, after
all.

With audio-rate m-sequence transmission, Morse code, and a flashing
light (and debug outputs on all the pins), it all came to about 100
bytes less than the 2 kB the chip has.  128 bytes of RAM seems to be
enough to hold the stack and the few registers it needs.  Kind of a
Pyrrhic victory.  I could have just stuck in a few delays in the main
loop and been done with it.

Just a little postscript:  here's the m-sequence generator in all its
glory.  Four lines of C code.  /That/ I knocked out in less than an
hour. 

#+name: code:
#+begin_src C

uint16_t galshift(uint16_t bits) {
  uint16_t carry = (bits & 0x01) << (REGLEN-1);
  uint16_t next = carry ? (bits^GPOLY) : bits;
  return carry + (next>>1);
}
